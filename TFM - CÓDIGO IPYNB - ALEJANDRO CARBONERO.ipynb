Para ello antes de describir insights en el EDA, vamos a hacer un pequeño preprocesamiento para obtener un análisis mas ajustado. La idea es tratar de tener todas las variable categoricas con 10 o menos valores distintos en los casos en los que sea eficiente y razonable hacerlo.\n",

    "#### 1.2.3.1 INSIGHTS VARIABLES CATEGÓRICAS\n",
    "1. \"Marital Status\":\n",
    "- La mayoría de los estudiantes se encuentra soltera/o (≈72%), seguida por los casados (≈7%). Las demás categorías —divorciado, unión de hecho, legalmente separado y viudo— presentan una representación muy baja (<2%).\n",
    "- La variable está altamente desbalanceada, por lo que para análisis o modelado futuro podría considerarse agrupar las categorías minoritarias en un bloque “Otros” para simplificar y evitar ruido, aunque la categoría mayoritaria probablemente capture la mayoría de patrones relevantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Application mode\":\n",
    "- La mayor parte de los estudiantes se concentra en las primeras fases de admisión: 1st phase - general contingent (≈32%) y 2nd phase - general contingent (≈16%). Otros grupos significativos incluyen Over 23 years old (≈15%) y Change of course (≈5%). Las restantes categorías representan menos del 5% de los registros cada una, siendo Transfer y Change of institution/course las menos frecuentes (<2%).\n",
    "- La variable está parcialmente desbalanceada. Para análisis o modelado futuro, podría ser útil agrupar las categorías con baja representación en un bloque “Others”, mientras se mantiene el detalle de los grupos más grandes para capturar patrones diferenciados de aplicación.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Application order\":\n",
    "- La gran mayoría de los estudiantes ha seleccionado su primera opción como prioridad: choice 1 representa ≈55% de los registros. Las opciones posteriores disminuyen progresivamente: choice 2 (≈10%), choice 3 (≈6%), choice 4 (≈5%), hasta llegar a las menos frecuentes choice 6 y choice 0, con menos del 3% combinadas. Choice 9 no tiene registros.\n",
    "- La variable refleja una fuerte preferencia por la primera opción de aplicación, con una caída pronunciada en las opciones subsecuentes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"Course\"\n",
    "- Nursing domina con ≈18%, seguido por Social Service, Journalism y Management (≈7–9%).\n",
    "- Carreras tecnológicas como Informatics Engineering o Biofuel Production Technologies son minoritarias (<3%).\n",
    "- Esto sugiere que la institución se orienta principalmente hacia salud y ciencias sociales, con baja atracción en ingenierías.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"Daytime/evening attendance\":\n",
    "- La gran mayoría cursa en horario diurno (≈89%), mientras que solo un 11% asiste en la modalidad de tarde/noche.\n",
    "- La variable está fuertemente desbalanceada y refleja que el perfil predominante son estudiantes de dedicación completa; la categoría “evening” podría tener importancia en casos de estudiantes trabajadores.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \"Previous qualification\":\n",
    "- Predomina la formación secundaria (≈82%), con menor representación de “Other/Spec” (≈8%), básica (≈4%) y superior (≈4%).\n",
    "- El fuerte peso de la secundaria indica que la mayoría accede directamente desde este nivel. Las categorías minoritarias podrían reagruparse en “Otros” en caso de simplificación.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. \"Nationality\":\n",
    "- La población estudiantil es mayoritariamente portuguesa (≈98%), con muy poca presencia internacional (menos del 2% repartido en múltiples países).\n",
    "- La variable está extremadamente desbalanceada, lo que la hace poco útil para el modelado predictivo; podría binarizarse como “portugués / no portugués”.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. \"Mother's qualification\":\n",
    "- Predomina la categoría Other/Unknown (≈60%), seguida de secundaria (≈22%) y superior (≈10%).\n",
    "- El elevado peso de datos faltantes (“Other/Unknown”) limita el valor informativo; puede requerir imputación o ser descartada si no aporta al modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. \"Father's qualification\":\n",
    "- La mayoría de los padres posee educación básica (≈66%), con secundaria (≈21%) y superior (≈9%).\n",
    "- La distribución sugiere un perfil parental de bajo nivel educativo, lo que podría estar relacionado con la tasa de éxito o permanencia de los estudiantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. \"Mother's occupation\":\n",
    "- Las categorías más frecuentes son Unskilled/Manual (≈37%) y Admin/Services (≈31%), seguidas por Other/Unknown (≈20%) y Specialized/Prof (≈14%).\n",
    "- La variable está algo desbalanceada, pero conserva suficiente información sobre el nivel ocupacional y profesional de la madre. Puede ser útil para analizar correlaciones con el desempeño estudiantil, aunque las categorías minoritarias podrían reagruparse si se busca simplificar el modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. \"Father's occupation\":\n",
    "- La mayoría de los registros corresponde a Unskilled/Manual (≈41%) y Armed Forces (≈31%), con menor representación de Admin/Services (≈18%), Other/Unknown (≈10%) y Specialized/Prof (≈4%).\n",
    "- La variable refleja un perfil profesional predominante en trabajos manuales y fuerzas armadas. La baja representación de las categorías minoritarias podría permitir agruparlas en un bloque “Otros” para simplificación sin perder información relevante.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. \"Displaced\":\n",
    "- Aproximadamente el 55% de los estudiantes están desplazados (viven fuera de su localidad de origen). Esto puede afectar su integración social y desempeño académico, por lo que podría ser relevante para predecir graduación o abandono.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. \"Educational special needs\":\n",
    "- Solo el 1% de los estudiantes presenta necesidades educativas especiales, indicando que la gran mayoría sigue la educación estándar. Esto limita la variabilidad de la variable, aunque los casos identificados podrían requerir apoyo adicional.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. \"Debtor\":\n",
    "- Alrededor del 11% de los estudiantes tiene deudas pendientes. Esto puede reflejar dificultades financieras que incrementen el riesgo de abandono.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. \"Tuition fees up to date\"\n",
    "- El 87% de los estudiantes tiene las cuotas al día. Mantener los pagos completos puede ser un indicador de estabilidad económica y compromiso con la continuidad académica.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. \"Gender\"\n",
    "- La distribución es aproximadamente 66% mujeres y 34% hombres. Diferencias de género pueden estar asociadas a patrones de rendimiento o permanencia en el programa, aunque no necesariamente determinantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. \"Scholarship holder\"\n",
    "- Cerca del 27% de los estudiantes recibe beca. Esto podría relacionarse con el rendimiento académico o la permanencia, reflejando apoyo financiero que facilita la continuidad del estudiante.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. \"International\"\n",
    "- Solo el 2% de los estudiantes son internacionales. Esto indica que la universidad está mayoritariamente compuesta por estudiantes locales, aunque los internacionales podrían enfrentar retos adicionales de adaptación y permanencia.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. \"Target\"\n",
    "- Distribución ≈61% graduados y 39% abandonos. Esta variable es el objetivo principal y permite evaluar la relación de todas las anteriores con la permanencia o deserción académica."

    "1. Age at enrollment:\n",
    "- La distribución está positivamente sesgada (skewness = 1.991), lo que indica que aunque la mayoría de los estudiantes ingresan en edades tempranas (cerca de 20 años), existe un grupo de estudiantes significativamente mayor. En el histograma observamos claramente como \n",
    "- Insight: Los estudiantes más mayores podrían enfrentar responsabilidades adicionales, como trabajo o familia, que podrían influir en su rendimiento académico o propensión a abandonar. Por el contrario, los más jóvenes podrían adaptarse más fácilmente al entorno universitario.\n",
    "2. Curricular units 1st sem (credited)\n",
    "- Sesgo positivo elevado (skewness ≈ 4.06) y kurtosis muy alta (≈ 17.99), lo que indica que la mayoría de los estudiantes tienen 0 créditos, pero unos pocos logran muchos créditos.\n",
    "- Insight: Los estudiantes que logran acumular créditos tempranamente muestran alto compromiso y probablemente menor riesgo de abandono (lo comprobaremos mas adelante), mientras que los que no logran créditos iniciales podrían necesitar apoyo académico.\n",
    "- Tiene una distribución extremadamente sesgada y curtosis altísima. La mayoría de estudiantes tiene 0, con unos pocos valores extremos. Esto aporta muy poca información general para el modelo, y puede actuar más como ruido que como predictor confiable. Podrías agruparlo, transformarlo o incluso descartarlo.\n",
    "3. Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)\n",
    "- Sesgo positivo (≈ 1.65) sugiere que algunos estudiantes se inscriben en una carga excesiva de unidades.\n",
    "- Insight: Una carga muy alta puede generar estrés y mayor riesgo de fracaso o abandono; la mayoría mantiene una carga promedio, lo que refleja planificación académica estándar.\n",
    "4. Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)\n",
    "- Sesgo positivo moderado (≈ 1.15), con estudiantes enfrentando muchas evaluaciones.\n",
    "- Insight: Un número elevado de evaluaciones podría indicar cursos más exigentes. Aquellos con muchas evaluaciones podrían tener mayor presión académica, lo que puede correlacionarse con riesgo de abandono si no gestionan bien su tiempo.\n",
    "5. Curricular units 1st sem (approved)\n",
    "- Sesgo ligeramente positivo (≈ 0.75), con la mayoría aprobando alrededor de 5 unidades.\n",
    "- Insight: El desempeño en el primer semestre es un indicador temprano del éxito académico. Los estudiantes con pocas aprobaciones iniciales podrían estar en riesgo de abandono.\n",
    "6. Curricular units 1st sem (grade)\n",
    "- Sesgo negativo (≈ -1.45), lo que indica que la mayoría tiene notas altas, pero algunos estudiantes tienen calificaciones muy bajas.\n",
    "- Insight: Las calificaciones bajas extremas pueden ser un predictor temprano de riesgo de abandono, mientras que la mayoría con buenas notas probablemente continuará hasta la graduación.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations)\n",
    "- Sesgo positivo extremo (≈ 8.72) y kurtosis muy alta (≈ 101.7), indicando que casi todos los estudiantes tienen 0 unidades sin evaluaciones, con unos pocos casos extremos.\n",

    "11. Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)\n",
    "- Sesgo ligeramente positivo (≈ 0.27), indicando que la mayoría aprueba un número promedio de unidades.\n",

    "12. Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)\n",
    "- Sesgo negativo moderado (≈ -1.17), similar al primer semestre, con mayoría de estudiantes obteniendo buenas notas.\n",

    "14. Unemployment rate\n",
    "- Distribución cercana a simétrica (skew ≈ 0.19).\n",
    "- Insight: Entorno macroeconómico estable, pero mayores tasas de desempleo podrían afectar indirectamente a estudiantes con trabajos parciales.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Inflation rate\n",
    "- Sesgo ligero positivo (≈ 0.27).\n",
    "- Insight: Variaciones leves en la inflación probablemente no afectan significativamente a los estudiantes, aunque podrían impactar en la capacidad de pago de matrícula.\n",

    "## 3.3 MODELOS DESCARTADOS\n",
    "En la primera fase de experimentación, antes de la depuración de variables, se evaluaron cuatro algoritmos: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting y KNN. Tras una primera revisión de resultados, se decidió descartar Gradient Boosting y KNN por las siguientes razones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "Aunque obtuvo un rendimiento aceptable (accuracy ≈ 90%), mostró un recall más bajo para la clase dropout (0.82), lo cual es crítico dado que el objetivo principal es identificar estudiantes en riesgo de abandono. Además, el modelo es más complejo de interpretar y ajustar respecto a Random Forest y Logistic Regression, lo que no justificaba su inclusión como candidato final.\n",
    "\n",
    "- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):\n",
    "Presentó el rendimiento más bajo entre los cuatro modelos (accuracy ≈ 87%) y un recall especialmente reducido en la clase dropout (0.74), lo que significa que dejó de identificar una proporción significativa de abandonos reales. Además, KNN tiende a escalar mal con grandes volúmenes de datos y carece de interpretabilidad en comparación con los modelos restantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tras la depuración final de variables, se repitió la comparación entre los modelos candidatos (Random Forest y Logistic Regression). Ambos mantuvieron un rendimiento muy similar en términos globales (accuracy ≈ 92%), pero se decidió descartar Random Forest y continuar únicamente con Logistic Regression por las siguientes razones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precisión global: Logistic Regression mantuvo una accuracy del 92%, muy similar a Random Forest, pero con métricas de equilibrio ligeramente más consistentes entre ambas clases.\n",
    "- Balance entre clases: Logistic Regression alcanzó un recall superior en la clase dropout (0.85 vs 0.83). Dado que el objetivo principal del trabajo es identificar estudiantes en riesgo de abandono, esta métrica tiene un peso clave en la decisión.\n",
    "- Interpretabilidad: Logistic Regression permite interpretar directamente los coeficientes de las variables y cuantificar su impacto en la probabilidad de abandono o graduación. Random Forest, aunque robusto, requiere técnicas adicionales (importancias de variables, SHAP values) que dificultan la comunicación de los resultados a responsables académicos o institucionales."
